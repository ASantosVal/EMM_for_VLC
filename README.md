README for 'Extended Metadata Manager for VLC' Repository
===============================

This repository has been created to carry out the Final Project for Asier Santos Valc√°rcel's Degree in Computer Engineering (Software Engineering branch). It has been marked with a 10

The objective was to learn VLC's way of working, its structure and finally to develop a functional module.

It's designed to process multiple file's metadata, to be able to edit them manually, to search them on [acoustId](https://acoustid.org/) and to permanently save them.
